            <p>I'm an aspiring web developer based in Lufkin, Texas, passionate 
                about creating valuable tools for companies and organizations. 
                My journey into coding began with a digital marketing course, 
                where I discovered the crucial role of website performance. 
                This sparked my interest in JavaScript and led me to explore 
                coding through platforms like Codecademy and Mimo. I am currently 
                enrolled in a coding bootcamp with The Ohio State University, 
                where I'm honing my skills. I aim to contribute to a dynamic tech 
                company, working on both front-end and back-end development to 
                create impactful software solutions.
