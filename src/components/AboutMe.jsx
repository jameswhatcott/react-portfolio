                <p>I'm a full-stack developer based in Lufkin, Texas, with a 
                    passion for creating innovative solutions that drive success 
                    for businesses and organizations. My coding journey started 
                    with a digital marketing course, where I discovered the 
                    critical importance of website performance. This ignited my 
                    curiosity about JavaScript and inspired me to dive deeper into 
                    coding through platforms like Codecademy and Mimo. After
                    completing a coding bootcamp at The Ohio State University, I
                    landed my first role as a developer at Blake Learning Solutions. 
                    There, I contribute to building websites for clients and 
                    developing Learning Management System (LMS) solutions. Iâ€™m eager 
                    to bring my skills to a dynamic tech company, where I can 
                    contribute to both front-end and back-end development, delivering 
                    software solutions that make an impact.
